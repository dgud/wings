--- 1.1.1 -------------------------------------------------------------------
- The data structure for the vertex tables has been changed.
  (There is one vertex table to keep track of the vertex positions,
  and another vertex table used for finding edges and face around
  the vertex.) The new data structure is faster and uses less memory.

- When displaying vertices and edges, a feature in OpenGL called vertex
  arrays is used to faster transfer the data from Wings into OpenGL.
  This way of displaying geometry is slightly faster than the previous
  method. [dgud, bjorng]

- ESDL updated to 1.0.1. (The next release in the 1.1 series will probably
  not work without that version of ESDL.) [bjorng]

- Magnets are now drawn correctly in Tweak when selections across multiple
  objects are dragged. [optigon]

- Selectings multiple objects in Tweak and calling a command via a hotkey would
  only affect one of the objects. Now corrected. [optigon]

- Crash reported by Fonte Boa corrected. [optigon]

- Tweak mode temporary selection fix. [optigon]

--- 1.1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a new preference in the Misc tab to turn on a Develop menu
  containing various tools for the Wings developers. [bjorng]

- Added a command to the new Develop menu to automatically time
  all executed commands. The command name and time will be printed
  to the console. [bjorng]

- Added a command to the new Develop menu to automatically print
  out information about the undo queue. [bjorng]

- The data structure for the edge table has been changed. The new
  data structure is faster and uses less memory. Approximately 4
  words (1 word = 4 bytes) per edge is saved.

  Plug-ins that depend on the edge table being a gb_tree will not
  work. More details can be found in the Change log (which follows
  these notes at Sourceforge). [bjorng, optigon]
