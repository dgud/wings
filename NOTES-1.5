  and suggested the new options) [Micheus]

- Fix unc paths on windows
  (Thanks to jentzenm.unofficialsony that reported this bug) [Micheus]

  When trying to saving a wings scene file to a path on the network
  using unc path, an error occurs (Save failed: no such file or
  directory) and the file was not saved. For some reason the first
  slash is removed from the path name when Save dialog returns the
  file name in the function wings_file:export_filename_1/2(after
  executed wings_plugin:call_ui()). The same occurs with Open dialog
  too. It seems to be a Erlang issue (I'm not sure). I did a
  workaround, then I could Save/Export/Import using an "unc" path
  without any problem. (Thanks to jentzenm.unofficialsony that
  reported this bug) [Micheus]

  Material->Select in the Outline window if selection mode isn't Face

  Cube%100%). [Micheus]
