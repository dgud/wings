   desktop. [Micheus]

- Added constraints to Sculpt mode menu. [optigon]

- Fixed the wrong selection of elements when using the option
  Material->Select in the Outline window if selection mode isn't Face
  or Body. Also, its context menu supports multiple options and it was
  added two new options: "Add to selection" and "Remove from
  selection". (Thanks to deerwood that reported the bug and suggested
  the new options) [Micheus]

- Added Select|By|Name option in which selections using a matching name can be made by combining the "*" wildcard.

  Now, Rename objects can be applied to several object at once, by
  using a selection or a search mask (like *box*). Also, the new name
  has a sequential number appended to it or placed in a defined
  position by using the "%" wildcard. It's possible to define the
  starter number by puting it between two "%" character (like:
  Cube%100%). [Micheus]

- Added two new options: Remove Invalid groups and Delete All groups.[Micheus]

- It was improved the Image Plane resource by adding a dialog box for
  enter options like: location, rotation around origin, lock it after

--- 1.4.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Major update to the Traditional Chinese translation of Wings
  including AutoUV, many plugins, tools, and other interface strings.
  Many thanks to szzz for this amazing contribution! [optigon]

- Wings could crash when launching and opening a file at the same
  time . The cause was the ets table for fonts could not be written to
  while the Progress Bar was active. ets tables can only be accessed from
  the process they are created in unless specifically stated. In Wings the
  PB run on a separate process so accessing the ets font table while the
  PB was active led to a badarg since the call was not allowed. The font
  table is now set to public so it can be accessed by any process.
  (Thanks to dgud and those who reported the crash) [optigon]

- Help dialog formatting adjustments for Asian fonts. [optigon]

  for unresolvable welds. (Thanks to Fonte Boa) [optigon]

- Tweak fixes including:
  -Rollup Palette would rollup Tweak Palette.
  -Tweak Axis Constraints would not toggle properly.
  -Code cleanup to improve font handling.
  (Thanks to BlackHarmo and Fonte Boa) [optigon]

- Face|Hide now works like the Hole command. The left mouse button
  hides selected faces, and the right mouse button unhides any hidden
  adjacent face. Also, some wording changes to make the hide/unhide
  routines more clear. [optigon]

- Changes to image import to return error when image exceeds
  graphics card limitations. [Micheus]

- Added translation macros to the Ambient Occlusion plugin.
  (Thanks to szzz) [optigon]

- New Fonts: Wings now includes CJK fonts which support
  Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Helvetica and Terminus fonts
  have also been added to offer some larger font sizes for
  accessibility reasons.
  
  To support the character sets in excess of 40 000 glyphs required
  for Asian language support, changes had to be made to the Wings font
  handler. Large font maps could cause slowdown, so now Wings uses a
  glyph accumulator to store only the glyphs required for the interface.
  
  Some further memory gains were afforded by only loading the fonts
  being used instead of all of them. Wings always required a restart
  to load a new font anyway, so no change to the user experience
  should be noticed.
  
  Thanks to iskunk for lending his time and expertise this effort.
  
  Those interested in adding translations to Wings can inquire on the
  Official Development Forum. Current efforts include a translation in
  Simplified Chinese by szzz, and Korean translation by korea3d.
  [optigon]

--- 1.3.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a 'wings_convert' script which can convert 3d files
  without starting wings. Requires an erlang install (and escript
  in your path) and a wings install.  On windows run with
  c:/path/to/erlang/bin/escript /path/to/wings_convert --help [dgud]

- AutoUV: Added a simple world space normal shader. [dgud]

- Added Select|Edge Loop|Select Nth Ring. [optigon]

- New Feature: Body|Explode scales objects from a defined center.
  Includes standard and user axes, uniform, and radial axis options.
  (Thanks to ggaliens for the idea) [optigon]

- New Feature: Rollup any window by clicking on its titlebar.
  The main Geometry window behaves differently and doesn't rollup.
  Instead, it moves from the foreground to the background, either
  covering or revealing any coexisting windows. [optigon]

- AutoUV: Added Move Horizontal and Vertical. [optigon]

- The arrow key and scroll wheel pan speed preferences have
  been changed to offer a more useful range of adjustment. [optigon]

- Minor changes to Tools|Connect to allow consecutive vertices
  to be placed  on the same edge. [optigon]

- Select|By|Sharp Edges now allows you to specify Peaks,
  Valleys, or Both. [optigon]

- Bug fix for Select Vertices with 6 or more edges. (Thanks to
  ggaliens). [optigon]

- For Developers: Added Show Cursor to the Develop menu. In cases
  where the cursor disappears during a crash, use this option to bring
  it back into view. I suggest hotkeying it so you don't have to fumble
  blindly to the menu. [optigon]

- Edge|Flatten (lmb) updated to recognize Edge groups instead of
  flattening to a common center. Also new, Edge|Flatten|Edge Loops,
  flattens any selected closed edge loop to it normal. [optigon]

- New Feature: Edge|Crease makes a stylized extrusion, commonly
  used for adding details such as wrinkles to organic models. [optigon]

- New View Along Axis option to set the view to the Nearest Axis
  whether that be X, Y, Z, or -X, -Y, -Z. Might be useful for those who
  would like to reduce their overall number of hotkeys and use one
  instead of six for axis navigation. [optigon]

- New Feature: Select|Edge Loop while in vertex mode will now
  convert consecutive vertices to edges. [optigon]

- AutoUV: Added Edge|Circularise to AutoUV. [optigon]

- New Feature: Vertex|Grid Snap takes a vertex selection and snaps
  each vertex to the closest point on a virtual grid as you drag to
  increase or decrease the grid's increment. [optigon]

- Position Highlight for Point light crash fixed. (Thank to
  Fonte Boa) [optigon]

- Build fixes. On some systems, makeself.sh is named makeself.sh
  and on others makeself, also they can reside in /usr/bin or
  /usr/local/bin. Tried to catch all cases. [giniu]

- In the Tools menu, Snap Image and Screenshot have been extended
  in several useful ways. It is now possible to take a screenshot of
  just the main viewport. Coupled with this feature are changes to
  Snap Image, which now has options to Fit the image to the viewport's
  dimensions. This new combination of features allows for better
  projection painting workflows using a 2d painting program like Gimp.
  The new Screenshot features are available through in its options
  dialog. You can also save the current view to the Saved Views at
  the same time and with the same name as the screenshot so that they
  can be aligned later. Additionally, one can now scale the snap image
  proportionally to its current x or y value, or reset the snap image
  to its actual size. Also, when exporting or making an image external
  from the Outliner, the image name will automatically update in the
  Outliner to the filename you save it as. [optigon]

- Add workaround option for mouse grab problems on linux.
  See option in preferences/misc. [dgud]

- Sweep extrusion normal fix. [optigon]

- New Feature: Edge|Corner takes an edge selection and adds corner
  geometry to any edges bordered by a 3 and 5 sided face. Then, adjust
  the tension before finalizing the corner. [optigon]

- New Feature: Plane Cut for Vertex, Face, and Body mode. Pick
  the plane and point for the cut, or slice the selection into even
  sections. Face and Body mode include a Loop Cut option. [optigon]

- Added .svg importer to convert 2d vector drawings to 3d. [optigon]

- Plugin Manager and menu format fixes. [optigon]

- Welding objects with only two faces could crash. (Thanks to
  Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- The "Scene Info: Area & Volume" command (in the tools menu)
  has been cosmetically improved and now properly displays the info
  in a multiple-column tabular-format, which is much easier to read. [scorpius]

- Mirroring a mirrored object could crash. Now fixed. (Thanks
  to Fonte Boa) [optigon]

- Image Planes are now created with a slight thickness and all
  their edges set to hard. [optigon]

- Face|Bridge has been extended to connect any two face regions
  regardless of how many faces or vertices they each have. [optigon]

- New View item to toggle Show Backfaces. [optigon]

- Saved selection groups have been updated to allow Cycling
  via hotkey, and this feature can be set to cycle only within the
  current selection mode. I also added some selection group deletion
  options. One option deletes all saved groups, and the other deletes
  only those groups that are corrupt. [optigon]

- I have changed the mouse buttons that perform secondary drag
  operations. For instance, Move|Free has an option to drag in the
  direction of the screen normal, and this option was bound to MMB.
  Now it is activated by holding LMB instead. Simiar changes were
  made to all the other tools that use a single secondary drag
  parameter. Also, introducing Hold LMB into the mix, allowed me to
  make Face|Sweep fully articulated between all four drag parameters
  (Extrude, Angle, Scale, and Rotation). [optigon]

- New Feature: Tools|Sculpt allows you to Push, Pull, Pinch, or
  Smooth geometry by dragging the the mouse over your model. There
  are Magnets and Strength parameters but it should be noted that
  this tool does not attempt to compare with other specialty
  sculpting programs. [optigon]

- Rewrite of Tweak to integrate it into the Wings core. [optigon]

- New interface features including:
  - A Menu Toolbar with icons for undo/redo, repeat last command,
  changing selection modes, and opening the Select or Tools
  menus can be switched on/off via Preferences|User Interface.
  
  - A new facility for saving and loading preferences from and
  into your current session, has been added to the File menu.
  These new preference subsets are appended with the .pref
  extension, and are saved separately from your 'master' Wings
  preference file. Additionally, both the Save and Load dialogs
  allow you to choose from preference catagories you'd like
  to load or save from: hotkeys, graphical elements, etc.
  
  - New icons for the Outliner and Geometry Graph that allow you
  to use custom colors for how they look. These icons can be
  switched on in Preferences|User Interface.
  
  - Added canned color themes. Switch between them in Edit|Themes.
  
  - The Geometry Graph now has folders and objects are stored
  alphabetically. You can create, rename, move objects between
  folders, and expand and contract them. You can also toggle
  wireframe, visibility, locking, and selections just within a
  folders pressing MMB on the Object, Eye, Lock, and Wireframe
  icons.
  
  - Added menu clipping. With all the additions to Wings over the
  years, the menus have been getting too long for smaller screens.
  To help the situation, I added a preference to set the Maximum
  Menu Height in pixels under the Misc tab in the Preferences.
  The default is set to 0, which auto clips menus to fit in the
  main Geometry window.
  
  [optigon]

- FBX plugin no longer supported, and removed from the wings source. [optigon]

- The Windows make_installer has been changed to use the vcredist
  included with Erlang and to work solely with Msys. [optigon]

- Edge|Circularise MMB fix. Center calculated incorrectly. [optigon]

--- 1.3.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- New Feature: Rotate|Unconstrained is a trackball style rotation tool
  contributed by ania, complete with magnets, user input rotation points,
  and accessibility from all selection modes. [Anna Celarek]

- Added Conditional Deselection option to improve Smart Highlighting. When
  checked, Deselect only enables Smart Highlighting when there is no selection,
  otherwise the selection is cleared with the selection mode maintained.
  [optigon]

- Secondary selection Vectors now disregard the Virtual Mirror face, as they
  should. [optigon]

- The Select|By tools have been extended to search for elements within the
  current selection, or if there is no selection, to search all visible objects.
  In addition, Random now has a user input field. [optigon]

- Fix to restore maximized Wings layout on MS Windows. [optigon]

- Fixed a small StereoLithography export bug. [scorpius]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notable new features in 1.2 (compared to 1.0.2)
===============================================

* The object mode (vertex color/material) for objects has
  been eliminated.
  
  Instead materials have a Vertex Colors setting that can be
  "Ignore" (don't use vertex colors; default for new materials),
  "Set" (to use vertex colors instead of the colors in the material),
  and "Multiply" (to multiply vertex colors with the diffuse texture).
  
  The material "default" has "Set" as the value for the "Vertex Colors"
  property, meaning that if you assign vertex colors to face having
  the "default" material, the vertex colors will be visible.
  
  There is a new command (with a sub-menu) in the body mode menu called
  "Vertex Attributes".
  
  When opening a .wings file written by Wings 1.1.7 or earlier, the
  object modes for the objects in the file will be ignored. If there
  are vertex colors, they will be visible on faces that have
  the 'default' material assigned. For faces with other materials,
  the colors or textures in the material will be shown (even if
  the object was in vertex color mode).
  
  When saving a .wings file in this version of Wings and opening
  it in an older version of Wings, all objects will be in
  material mode (even if they have vertex colors).

* Wings have had the _hole_ material for a long time to fake
  holes by marking faces that should not be included when exporting.
  
  There is a new Face|Hole command to create a holes
  that looks like holes also in the Geometry window.
  
  To remove a hole, select a face adjacent to the hole and RMB
  click on the Face|Hole command to create a face to cover the
  hole.
  
  When loading old .wings files, all faces containing the _hole_
  material will be converted to the new type of hole.
  
  If you load a .wings file saved with this version of Wings in
  an old release, the holes will become hidden faces, but they
  will NOT have the _hole_ material (i.e. they will not behave
  as holes when exported).

* The smooth proxy is now updated directly when invoking
  interactive commands.

* Menu Cleanup: Consolidated Extrude with Extrude Region and Extract Region with
  Extract Faces. Since there is now only one heading each for Extrude and
  Extract, the mouse buttons that activate specific commands have been changed.

* Collada export. Objects including UV coordinates and materials
  are exported. Lights and cameras are not exported yet.

* New in Tools menu: Ambient-Occlusion Generator/Baker. It works on a per-
  vertex basis and uses a standard inside-out approach. Mesh subdivision
  yields more accuracy. The results are stored in the vertex-colors and can
  also be baked to a texture through AutoUV.

* Many improvements and bug fixes in the Tweak mode.

* The Wavefront (OBJ) exporter will now export smoothing
  groups based on the hard edges in the model.

Eliminated annoyances
=====================

* If View|Scene Lights has been turned on, but the scene
  contains no lights, the usual modeling lights will be turned on
  instead so the objects do not turn black.

* When displaying objects that have a virtual mirror face in
  the smooth preview mode (i.e. turning off workmode by pressing TAB),
  the seam between the real part of the object and mirror image will
  now be soft.

Performance
===========

* Picking (i.e. finding out which face is under the mouse
  cursor) is no longer done using OpenGL, but by our own
  C code, which is both faster and more reliable.

* The internal data structures for edge and vertex tables require
  less memory than in Wings 1.0, which should also improve
  peformance.

* The display code has been extensively rewritten and now uses
  vertex buffers in OpenGL. It should be faster in most
  circumstances.
--- 1.2.rc3 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- Wings could not always save the preferences on Windows Vista
  and Windows 7 because the registry has a different layout.
  Wings will no longer attempt to use the registry to find an
  appropriate directoy into which preferences should be saved,
  but will use the documented Windows API function.
  
  Note to developers: You will need to adjust your scripts/shortcuts
  for starting Wings. See BUILD.win32. [bjorng]

- Dissolving or collapsing an isolated vertex could
  cause a crash. (Thanks to ania.) [bjorng]

- Fixed various hidden/hole face drawing problems. Hidden hard
  edges was drawn reported by Ania. Smooth-preview showed edges on
  hidden faces and the backside of visible faces was not shown in flat
  shaded view. [dgud]

--- 1.1.16 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Wings now compiles cleanly on FreeBSD. [scorpius]

- For developers: Erlang/OTP R13B02 is now required for building
  Wings. [bjorng]

- When importing holes were not always handled correctly.
  There could be faces marked as holes internally, but the faces
  would still be visible. Future operations (such as Combine), could
  then cause the faces to suddenly disappear (i.e. become holes).
  (Thanks to Siber.) [bjorng]

- Wings will now validate holes when loading .wings files,
  and remove from the list of holes any non-existent face or
  face that is not invisible. (Importing objects with holes and
  saving in a previous release of Wings could cause such
  inconsistencies, as described in the previous release note.)
  [bjorng]

- Selecting many elements in many objects using marquee
  selection is now much faster. (Thanks to ycarry for noticing
  the slowness.) [bjorng]

- The Separate command is now significantly faster when run
  on objects with many sub-objects. (Thanks to ycarry for noticing
  the slowness.) [bjorng]

- Opening .wings files without vertex attributes is now
  slightly faster. (Thanks to ycarry.) [bjorng]

- Added Bbox Move and Scale to Selection tools. BBox now
  displays with a visible center and uses the user define Vector
  colour. [optigon]

- Added colour prefs for the Menubar and Info Line Text. [optigon]

--- 1.1.15 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- It was not possible to load JPEG, PNG, or GIF images (either
  as textures or using the Image Plane commands) on Snow Leopard.
  (Thanks to Riolan and nobrandname.) [bjorng]

- The Tools|Virtual Mirror|Create command will now
  automatically flatten the virtual mirror face. [bjorng]

- The Select|Edge Loop|Edge Loop To Region command will
  now allow virtual mirror and hole edges to close an edge loop.
  (Suggested by FonteBoa.) [bjorng]

- Combine and Separate became much slower in 1.1 if there
  were many objects in the scene. This has been corrected.
  (Thanks to ycarry.) [dgud/bjorng]

- Select by material is now much faster for big objects with
  more than one material. (Thanks for ycarry for noticing the
  slowness.) [bjorng]

- Gordo has designed new (much nicer) install and uninstall icons
  for the installer on Windows. [bjorng]

- Undoing a change of UV coordindates would not update the
  AutoUV window. (Thanks to no204.) [bjorng]

- Creating a new Geometry window and moving the mouse cursor
  over the toolbar of the new window before doing anything else would
  cause Wings to crash. (Thanks to BlackHarmo.) [bjorng]

- Area lights can now be selected from both sides, not only
  from the front face. (Thanks to Micheus.) [bjorng]

- Newer LWO files may contain a sub form of POLS called SUBD.
  Unfortunately, I have found no description on how to interpret those
  forms. If you happen to know how to interpret those forms, please
  post a message in the Programming forum. The LWO importer will now
  quit with an error message instead of crashing when encountering
  ae SUBD form. (Thanks to Siber.) [bjorng]

- Fixes to Sweep. (Thanks to BlackHarmo and Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- Windows could appear above the visible screen area. Now some code
  checks for this as windows are loaded and moves them within the visible
  range. [optigon]

--- 1.1.14 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- If View|Scene Lights has been turned on, but the scene
  contains no lights, the usual modeling lights will be turned on
  instead so the objects do not turn black. [bjorng]

- Undoing Absolute Command|Snap would undo the preceding
  command too. (Thanks to BlackHarmo.) [bjorng]

- In vertex selection mode, unselected vertices would not be
  shown if there were any hidden faces or holes. [bjorng]

- Some inconsistencies noticed by gordo in the user-interface
  have been corrected. [bjorng]

- New Feature: Collada export. Objects including
  UV coordinates and materials are exported. Lights and
  cameras are not exported yet. [metadave]

--- 1.1.13 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Selecting two objects, one with a virtual mirror and one
  without a virtual mirror, and Tweaking the object with the virtual
  mirror would cause a crash. (Thanks to BlackHarmo.)
  
  For developers: wings_pick:do_pick/3 and wpa:pick/3 returns more
  information about what was picked in the second element of the
  result tuple. Plug-ins that use the second element must
  be updated. [bjorng]

- Select|Edge Loop|Edge Loop (and Grow/Shrink Edge Loop) can
  now select edge loops around holes. [bjorng]

- This release for Mac OS X has been built with Snow
  Leopard (10.6) as the host OS. It is still supposed to work on
  Tiger (10.4) with either PPC or Intel CPUs, but I have no way to
  actually test that. [bjorng]

- On Windows, the wings_crash.dump file will now be written to the
  Desktop, since writing it to the installation directory for Wings
  would not work in Windows Vista or Windows 7. [bjorng]

- Vertex colors that were completely white were not saved in
  .wings files. (Thanks to tuxtax.) [bjorng]

- The '+' and '-' keys on the keypad can now be used for
  adjusting the magnet radius in Tweak mode. [bjorng]

--- 1.1.12 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- For developers: In the source distribution, there is a new
  text file CodingGuidelines containing coding guidelinings for
  Erlang programming in general and Wings programming in particular.
  (Thanks to optigon, deerwood, and scorpius for comments on the
  first draft.) [bjorng]

- For developers: Basic multiple column support has been
  implemented in the table widget in wings_ask. [bjorng]

- Doing a vertex bevel on an object with both vertex attributes
  and a virtual mirror would cause a crash. (Thanks to ycarry.) [bjorng]

- Exporting objects with holes and more than one material
  would cause a crash. (Thanks to ycarry and TulipVorlax.) [bjorng]

- Exporting a scene with area lights with the Yafray exporter
  would cause a crash. (Thanks to spacemanspiff7.) [bjorng]

--- 1.1.11 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Clicking the Cancel button in the file dialog for Mac OS X
  would cause a hard crash. (Thanks to ycarry.) [bjorng]

- Wings have had the _hole_ material for a long time to fake
  holes by marking faces that should not be included when exporting.
  
  This release introduce the command Face|Hole to create a holes
  that looks like holes also in the Geometry window.
  
  To remove a hole, select a face adjacent to the hole and RMB
  click on the Face|Hole command to create a face to cover the
  hole.
  
  When loading old .wings files, all faces containing the _hole_
  material will be converted to the new type of hole.
  
  If you load a .wings file saved with this version of Wings in
  an old release, the holes will become hidden faces, but they
  will NOT have the _hole_ material (i.e. they will not behave
  as holes when exported). [bjorng]

- The Turn Edge command will now only turn edges that have
  visible faces on both sides. In previous releases, it would happily
  turn edges next to invisible faces (even edges making up the
  virtual mirror face). [bjorng]

- Face|Extrude (on regions) could be slow if many faces were
  selected in a pattern with many inner corners (e.g. the selection
  obtained by first selecting a single face and then pressing
  "F" repeatedly). [bjorng]

- Palette window: Fixed crash and made the scan command aware
  of the selection mode. (Thanks to Fonteboa and Deerwood.) [dgud]

- Added an edge filter. Original idea and code from Ed Kolis. [dgud]

- Yafray exporter:
  * Changed default settings for Photon Spotlight.
  
  * Added to Help info.
  
  * Changed type for HDRI from HDRI to Image.
  
  * Added .EXR to HDRI Background file browser.
  
  * Added Prefilter option for Ambient light background. [oort]

--- 1.1.10 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Tools|Snap Image was broken in several ways. It will now
  also preserve vertex colors. (Thanks to PuzzledPaul.) [bjorng]

- Attempting to extrude an edge between two isolated vertices
  would cause a crash. [bjorng]

- Extrude in edge mode would distort UV coordinates and
  vertex colors. That has been corrected. [bjorng]

- When the hemispherical shader was active, vertex colors was
  shown even for materials that disabled vertex colors, provided
  that the object had at least one material with vertex colors
  enabled. [bjorng]

- Wings 1.1.9 (and 1.1.9.1) would crash when attempting to open
  a .wings file containing area lights saved by a previous version of
  Wings. This has been corrected.  Furthermore, when saving area
  lights, they will be saved in the same way as in versions before
  1.1.9. That means that a .wings file containing area lights saved
  by this version of Wings cannot be opened by 1.1.9.x, but it can
  be opened by older versions such as 1.0.1 and 1.1.8.
  (Thanks to Micheus.) [bjorng]

- Autouv: Fixed Face|Project Unfold crash when every face in
  the chart was selected. [dgud]

--- 1.1.9.1 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- File dialogs would crash on Linux in the 1.1.9
  release. [bjorn]

--- 1.1.9 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Calculations of smoothing groups in the Wavefront exporter
  could crash if there was two different edges between the same pair
  of vertices. (Thanks to Siber for reporting this bug.)
  
  For plugin developers: A new field, sg, containing an integer
  representing the smoothing group has been added to the #e3d_face{}
  record. Plug-ins using that record must be re-compiled. [bjorng]

- In the Smoothed Preview mode, changes to vertex colors or
  UV coordinates would not be visible. (Thanks to FonteBoa.) [bjorng]

- Fixed the bugs in the View|Show Colors and View|Show Materials
  reported by Micheus. Also made sure that a change to the vertex
  color option of a material would immediately be seen in the
  scene. [bjorng]

- Repeat cmds for Extrude now fixed. (Thanks to Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- Bevel for vertices now properly updates UV coordinates and
  vertex colors dynamically during dragging. (In the Smoothed Preview
  mode, the UV coordinates will only become correct when the drag
  has finished.) [bjorng]

- If the workaround against disappearing text was enabled,
  there would be crash when attempting to display any character
  not included in the fonts, which could happen when using the
  file dialog on Linux to browse a file system where the filenames
  are encoded using UTF-8. (Thanks to mifth.) [bjorng]

- In the file dialog on Mac OS X, selecting a filename
  containing non-US ASCII characters (such as the Swedish
  letters ﾅ, ﾄ, or ﾖ) would cause a hard crash. [bjorng]

- By default, the file dialog box for Linux now assumes
  that filenames are encoded in UTF-8. There is a new checkbox
  to revert to the previous behaviour (that is, to assume that
  filenames are encoded in ISO latin1). [bjorng]

--- 1.1.8 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Switching to the Smoothed Preview mode would cause a crash
  if there were any area lights in the scene. (Thanks to Micheus.)
  [bjorng]

- For plug-in developers: The new function wpa:version/0
  returns the version string for Wings. [bjorng]

- Edit|Repeat (Ctrl+D) was broken since 1.1.3. Either it did nothing
  at all or caused a crashed. (Thanks to optigon and deerwood.) [bjorng]

- Magnet Mask|Select bugs fixed. (Thanks to GetaVe and Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- Using one of the commands Show Colors, Show Materials, or
  Show Textures in the View|Show sub-menu, the scene would not be
  immediately updated to reflect the change. Furthermore, if
  Show Colors was turned off and there was an object with vertex
  colors in the scene, there would be a crash. [bjorng]

- AutoUV used to hold a copy of the scene to be able to
  generate a texture with vertex colors or materials.
  
  This extra scene copy has been eliminated. When doing the initial
  UV mapping of an object without previous UV coordinates, the
  materials on the object will be converted to vertex colors (this
  will only be done if there are no previous vertex colors in the
  object AND if the object has non-default materials). The vertex
  colors in the object can later be used to generate a texture.
  
  With this change, vertex colors generated by the Ambient Occlusion
  command can now be baked into a texture. [bjorng]

- If the material 'default' in a .wings file does not have exactly
  the same properties as the 'default' material in Wings, the material
  itself would be renamed to something else (typically 'default2'),
  but the material for the faces that used the material would NOT
  be assigned the new name. [bjorng]

- The object mode (vertex color/material) for objects has
  been eliminated.
  
  Instead materials have a Vertex Colors setting that can be
  "Ignore" (don't use vertex colors; default for new materials),
  "Set" (to use vertex colors instead of the colors in the material),
  and "Multiply" (to multiply vertex colors with the diffuse texture).
  
  The material "default" has "Set" as the value for the "Vertex Colors"
  property, meaning that if you assign vertex colors to face having
  the "default" material, the vertex colors will be visible.
  
  There is a new command (with a sub-menu) in the body mode menu called
  "Vertex Attributes".
  
  When opening a .wings file written by Wings 1.1.7 or earlier, the
  object modes for the objects in the file will be ignored. If there
  are vertex colors, they will be visible on faces that have
  the 'default' material assigned. For faces with other materials,
  the colors or textures in the material will be shown (even if
  the object was in vertex color mode).
  
  When saving a .wings file in this version of Wings and opening
  it in an older version of Wings, all objects will be in
  material mode (even if they have vertex colors).
  
  For plug-in writers: #we.mode has been removed. It also means that
  plug-ins that use #we{} needs to be re-compiled. [bjorng]

--- 1.1.7 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In rare circumstances, the progress bar could reach 1.0
  (the far end) even if the operation was not finished and cause
  Wings to crash hard. (Thanks to deerwood.) [bjorng]

- The smooth proxy is now updated directly when invoking
  interactive commands. [dgud]

- New Feature: Create Bounding Box added to the primitives menu. [optigon]

- Scale to Bounding Box selections now keep their original centre. [optigon]

- Turn Edge now preserves Hard Edges. (Thanks to BlackHarmo). [optigon]

- New Feature: Select|Edge Loop|To Complete Loops turns any selection
  into an edge loop selection. Works from all selection modes and is based on
  the request by deerwood to be able to extend loops beyond where they stop
  when using the regular Edge Loop command (L). [optigon]

- Dissolve and Collapse cmds now delete wholly selected efficiently. [optigon]

- Shared vertices are now eliminated on import. (The
  modeling commands in Wings does not allow creating of shared
  vertices (also called waists), i.e. faces that only share vertices
  but no edges, so it should not be allowed on import.) [bjorng]

- When displaying objects that have a virtual mirror face in
  the smooth preview mode (i.e. turning off workmode by pressing TAB),
  the seam between the real part of the object and mirror image will
  now be soft. The Smooth command (and the Smooth Proxy mode) will
  still sub-divide faces around the virtual mirror face as if the
  edges were hard, so Smoothing before freezing the mirror and
  after freezing may still not give exactly the same result
  (how close the result is depends on the object; for some objects
  the difference may not be noticeable). [bjorng]

- New Feature: Magnet Mask Deselect - Subtracts locked elements from
  the current selection. (Thanks to Fonte Boa) [metadave, optigon]
  
  Magnet Mask Select - fixed: Adds locked elements to current selection.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa). [optigon]

--- 1.1.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Re-exporting an imported model with tesselation could
  cause a crash. Also, when importing objects that had UV coordinates
  on some faces but not all, UV coordinates would be discarded
  on both side of edges that only had UV coordinates on one side.
  (Thanks to Siber.) [bjorng]

- Separating, then Combining an object with vertex
  attributes would cause a crash. (Thanks to zdarby.) [bjorng]

- Smoothing objects with hidden faces would crash. [bjorng]

- The command Select By|Id would crash in body mode. [bjorng]

- Eliminate selection glitches where elements behind a face
  could be selected through the face. (Thanks to deerwood.) [bjorng]

- Wings would freeze if there were empty objects in the
  scene. (Empty objects can only be created by import or possibly
  by a plug-in, as the core Wings commands will delete an object
  that becomes empty.) [bjorng]

- The Ambient Occlusion plugin will now correctly
  ignore hidden or locked objects. [scorpius]

- Some fixes and improvements to Edge|Circularise. Open edge loops
  should process more uniformly. (Thanks to puzzledpaul). [optigon]

- Warp mouse to proper position follow drag in Tweak. [optigon]

- Toggling xyz constraints in tweak wouldn't update the info line.
  Now fixed. [optigon]

- Tweak Slide would not work correctly for single edges and
  would not work at all for selections of two unconnected vertices.
  Now fixed. (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Tweak Slide would not stop at edges. Also made some
  optimisations. [optigon]

--- 1.1.5 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed Tweak drag Normal. (Thanks to Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- Moving or duplicating a light in body mode would cause
  a crash on the next attempt to select anything.
  (Thanks to extrudeface.) [bjorng]

- Marquee selection would selected locked vertices or edges.
  (Thanks to ycarry.) [bjorng]

- Select|Similar is now faster if the initial selection
  contains elements that are similar to each other.
  (Thanks to Ran13.) [bjorng]

- The Wavefront (OBJ) exporter now tries to minimize
  the number of smoothing groups. (Thanks to Ran13.) [bjorng]

- Fixed loading models when in smooth-preview mode.
  Reported by Ran13. [dgud]

- There is a major internal change in how vertex attributes
  (i.e. vertex colors and UV coordinates that are associated with
  a vertex in a particular face) are handled.
  
  Vertex attributes used to be stored in the edge table (with
  two words per edge always reserved for vertex attributes)
  and each vertex could have EITHER a vertex color or
  UV coordinates.
  
  Vertex attributes are now stored by themeselves. Objects
  without vertex attributes will consume less memory (two
  words per edge less than in previous releases). Each
  vertex can now have both a vertex color and UV coordinates.
  
  The wings file format should be completely compatible. If
  you load a wings file containing an object with both vertex
  colors and UV coordinates into an older release of Wings,
  only the UV coordinates will be kept. (If you resave such
  a file from an older version of Wings, the vertex colors
  will be permanently lost.)
  
  Most commands have not been updated yet to take full
  advantage of the new vertex attribute implementation. So
  while Ambient Occlusion will preserve existing UV coordinates,
  there is no way yet to show vertex colors at the same time
  as textures.
  
  You can use the commands "Material Mode" and "Vertex Color Mode" in
  the body mode menu to switch between seeing materials/textures and
  vertex colors. (The commands are not new, but there were few
  situations in which they were needed in previous releases of Wings.)
  In a future release, we will probably eliminate those commands and
  extend materials so that you can choose whether vertex colors,
  materials/textures, or a mixture of both should be shown.
  
  Performance seems to be about the same if there are no
  vertex attributes, but somewhat slower for models with
  vertex attributes.
  
  For developers: Plug-ins using #edge.a and #edge.b will not
  compile. Instead use the new wings_va module that provides an API
  to the vertex attributes. I have tried to comment each
  exported function in the API. [bjorng]

--- 1.1.4.1 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- Having wireframe on and workmode off would cause a
  crash. (Thanks to Siber.) [bjorng]

- Select By|Vertices With could select hidden vertices
  (i.e. vertices surrounded only by hidden faces). Similarly,
  Select By|Random could select hidden edges or vertices,
  and Select By|Short Edges and Select By|Sharp Edges could
  select hidden edges. [bjorng]

- The Wavefront (OBJ) exporter will now export smoothing
  groups based on the hard edges in the model. [bjorng]

- For developers: There is a new module wings_va
  which is ultimately meant to encapsulate the details
  of how vertex attributes (i.e. vertex colors and UV
  coordinates) are stored. In this release, wings_va has
  an API mostly for retrieving vertex attributes (i.e.
  it does not yet handle updating of vertex attributes).
  In particular, all functions in wings_face that could
  retrieve vertex attributes (such as vinfo_ccw/2 and
  fold_vinfo/4) have been removed. [bjorng]

--- 1.1.4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- For developers: Release notes to be included in a release
  should no longer be directly added to NOTES-1.1 files, but
  instead be written into the check-in comment. Everything in
  a comment from "NOTE:" (without the quotations marks) at
  the beginning of a line to the end of the check-in comment,
  will be included in the release notes.
  
  To extract the release notes, run the script tools/extract_notes.
  It will extract and print all notes for all commits after
  the tag for the latest release. [bjorng]

- The Edge Ring command (Select|Edge Loop|Edge Ring) would
  select edges between hidden faces. [bjorng]

- Selection (finding out which face is under the mouse
  cursor) used to be done using a special selection render
  mode in OpenGL. However, this mode does not work well
  in all OpenGL drivers. Therefore I have implemented my
  own code for selection handling in C as a driver for the
  Erlang emulator. (Thanks to FonteBoa for testing.) [bjorng]

- The proxy mode has been optimized by using vertex arrays. [dgud]

--- 1.1.3 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- Torsten Manz updated the German translation. [bjorng]

- Menu Cleanup: Consolidated Extrude with Extrude Region and Extract Region with
  Extract Faces. Since there is now only one heading each for Extrude and
  Extract, the mouse buttons that activate specific commands have been changed.
  Please see the related info lines for details. [optigon]

- Crash when using Shift Spherical (mmb option) now fixed.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Edge|Collapse now deletes edges more uniformly than the previous
  implementation. Also, a Rmb option has been added to automatically cleanup
  any newly created isolated vertices resulting from the collapse edges.
  (Thanks to deerwood and Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- On OpenGL implementations without support for multisampling,
  there would be (harmless) error messages written to the console
  Develop|OpenGL Errors had been turned on. Changed to only
  attempt to use multisampling if the OpenGL implementation supports
  it, and no longer showing the checkbox in the preferences for
  turning on/off multisampling if the OpenGL implementation does
  not support it. [bjorng]

- If a command executed through a hotkey causes an error,
  a dialog box with some help will be shown. [bjorng]

- Major rewrite of how geometry data is sent to OpenGL. We used
  to have a specially written driver, but for future compatibility
  we cannot use a driver. Instead we use vertex arrays.

  This is the first step in this direction and we expect to do
  further optimizations. For the moment, some display updates
  can be slower and some can be faster than before.

  As part of this change, the OpenGL renderer has been removed.
  Sorry for any inconvenience, but it had to go. [dgud & bjorng]

- This release uses R13B01. A bug fix in the array module in R13B01
  eliminates a crash that occurred when all edges in an object
  were dissolved. [bjorng]

- This development release also includes all bug fixes in the 1.0.1 release.

--- 1.1.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------
- Select Similar Normals with the option Connected Faces Only and
  a selection comprising multiple objects would cause a crash.
  (Thanks to pauljs75.) [bjorng]

- Using the Slide command with Clean (Ctrl+Alt+L) would crash.
  (Thanks to gordo.) [bjorng]

- AutoUV: Doing ReMap UV and choosing Strech Optimization would
  cause a crash. (Thanks to betelguese.) [bjorng]

- When creating a texture from vertex colors in the AutoUV window, the
  colors will be properly interpolated (smoothed). [scorpius]

- Keyboard events in Tweak while dragging could cause slow downs. Now Fixed.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Additional Geometry Windows can now be closed from within Tweak mode.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Dragging in Tweak is no longer limited to the size of the current window.
  [optigon]

- Conflicts due to mouse events in adjacent Geometry Windows have been solved by
  locking the focus to the original window during paint selection and dragging
  in Tweak Mode. (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- New Tweak option to set Tweak Magnet Increment. [optigon]

- Spherical UV mapping corrected. [dgud]

- There are two new commands in the optional Develop menu:

  * Develop|OpenGL Errors to check for and display OpenGL errors after
    each command.
  * Develop|Print Scene Size to print the scene size.

  Also, the existing commands Time Commands and Undo Stat now handle
  plug-in commands properly.

  The command Tools|Memory Info has been removed. [bjorng]

- New in Tools menu: Ambient-Occlusion Generator/Baker. It works on a per-
  vertex basis and uses a standard inside-out approach. Mesh subdivision
  yields more accuracy. The results are stored in the vertex-colors and can
  also be baked to a texture through AutoUV. [scorpius]

- Extended Shift plugin to work in all selection modes. [optigon]

- New Plugin: Extract Faces. Like Extract Region but extracts individual faces.
  [optigon]

--- 1.1.1 -------------------------------------------------------------------
- The data structure for the vertex tables has been changed.
  (There is one vertex table to keep track of the vertex positions,
  and another vertex table used for finding edges and face around
  the vertex.) The new data structure is faster and uses less memory.
  [bjorng]

- When displaying vertices and edges, a feature in OpenGL called vertex
  arrays is used to faster transfer the data from Wings into OpenGL.
  This way of displaying geometry is slightly faster than the previous
  method. [dgud, bjorng]

- ESDL updated to 1.0.1. (The next release in the 1.1 series will probably
  not work without that version of ESDL.) [bjorng]

- Magnets are now drawn correctly in Tweak when selections across multiple
  objects are dragged. [optigon]

- Selectings multiple objects in Tweak and calling a command via a hotkey would
  only affect one of the objects. Now corrected. [optigon]

- Crash reported by Fonte Boa corrected. [optigon]

- Tweak mode temporary selection fix. [optigon]

--- 1.1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added a new preference in the Misc tab to turn on a Develop menu
  containing various tools for the Wings developers. [bjorng]

- Added a command to the new Develop menu to automatically time
  all executed commands. The command name and time will be printed
  to the console. [bjorng]

- Added a command to the new Develop menu to automatically print
  out information about the undo queue. [bjorng]

- The data structure for the edge table has been changed. The new
  data structure is faster and uses less memory. Approximately 4
  words (1 word = 4 bytes) per edge is saved.

  Plug-ins that depend on the edge table being a gb_tree will not
  work. More details can be found in the Change log (which follows
  these notes at Sourceforge). [bjorng, optigon]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 1.0.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Edge|Collapse could crash in some cases. Now fixed. [optigon]

- The Edge Ring command (Select|Edge Loop|Edge Ring) would
  select edges between hidden faces. [bjorng]

- Fixed Tweak drag Normal. (Thanks to Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- In rare circumstances, the progress bar could reach 1.0
  (the far end) even if the operation was not finished and cause
  Wings to crash hard. (Thanks to deerwood.) [bjorng]

- If the workaround against disappearing text was enabled,
  there would be crash when attempting to display any character
  not included in the fonts, which could happen when using the
  file dialog on Linux to browse a file system where the filenames
  are encoded using UTF-8. (Thanks to mifth.) [bjorng]

- In the file dialog on Mac OS X, selecting a filename
  containing non-US ASCII characters (such as the Swedish
  letters ﾅ, ﾄ, or ﾖ) would cause a hard crash. [bjorng]

- It was not possible to load JPEG, PNG, or GIF images (either
  as textures or using the Image Plane commands) on Snow Leopard.
  (Thanks to Riolan and nobrandname.) [bjorng]

- This release for Mac OS X has been built with Snow
  Leopard (10.6) as the host OS. It is still supposed to work on
  Tiger (10.4) with either PPC or Intel CPUs, but I have no way to
  actually test that. [bjorng]

--- 1.0.1 -------------------------------------------------------------------
- Magnets are now drawn correctly in Tweak when selections across multiple
  objects are dragged. [optigon]

- Selectings multiple objects in Tweak and calling a command via a hotkey would
  only affect one of the objects. Now corrected. [optigon]

- Tweak Crash to do with unchecked camera mode reported by Fonte Boa corrected.
  [optigon]

- Tweak mode temporary selection fix. [optigon]

- Select Similar Normals with the option Connected Faces Only and
  a selection comprising multiple objects would cause a crash.
  (Thanks to pauljs75.) [bjorng]

- When creating a texture from vertex colors in the AutoUV window, the
  colors will be properly interpolated (smoothed). [scorpius]

- Keyboard events in Tweak while dragging could cause slow downs. Now Fixed.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Additional Geometry Windows can now be closed from within Tweak mode.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- Dragging in Tweak is no longer limited to the size of the current window.
  [optigon]

- Conflicts due to mouse events in adjacent Geometry Windows have been solved by
  locking the focus to the original window during paint selection and dragging
  in Tweak Mode. (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [optigon]

- New Tweak option to set Tweak Magnet Increment. [optigon]

- Spherical UV mapping corrected. [dgud]

- Doing a Doo-Sabin sub-division on multiple objects would leave an
  invalid selection that could cause crashes. (Thanks to Fonte Boa.) [bjorng]

- Very old Wings files could have invalid mirror faces, which would cause
  crashes. Now clearing the mirror face if it is invalid when loading
  a Wings file. [bjorng]

--- 1.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Gordo eliminated some color banding in the task switching icon on Windows
  and also cleaned up the edges on that icon. [bjorng]

--- 1.0.rc3 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- The icon in the top left corner of the Wings windows (in Windows) and in
  the Dock (on Mac OS X), now has transparency. I have also added a README
  file to the "psd" directory in the source distribution to explain the
  purpose of each Photoshop file. [bjorng]

- Geometry Graph wouldn't always focus on mouseover. Now fixed.
  (Thanks to SoulVector) [optigon]

- Wings could crash if while dragging the rmb was held and the lmb was clicked.
  Now fixed. (Thanks to Nanakisan) [optigon]

- Various fixes and clean up to Tweak. [optigon]

- Wings will show an error message when it fails to do sphere mapping
  instead of crashing. (Thanks to deerwood.) [dgud]

--- 1.0-rc2 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- This is the second release candiate for the long-awaited Wings 1.0 release.
  Until 1.0 is released, we will only fix bugs. [bjorng]

- Updated the build instructions in the BUILD.unix and BUILD.win32 files
  to note that R13B and esdl-1.0 are now required. Also updated the
  AUTHORS file. [bjorng]

- The eyedropper tool is now working. The actual bug was in ESDL and
  has been fixed esdl-1.0. (Thanks to Scorpius.) [bjorng]

- The icon in top left corner of the Wings windows (in Windows) was still
  the old one, and so was the icon on the application switching screen (Alt+Tab
  in Windows). I have now replaced the icon with the new one, but unfortunately
  I could not use any transparancy so I had to pick a light gray color
  that at least in Windows XP is not that noticeable. (This particular icon
  is set through SDL and SDL only allows a hard-edged mask which might make
  the edges look jagged. I haven't actually tried setting an hard-edged mask
  yet because it didn't work in esdl-0.96.0626 - I might try it for the next
  Release Candidate now that the bug is fixed in esdl-1.0.) [bjorng]

- If Smart Highlighting was turned on, and the hard edge width was set to 1, and
  the selected-edge width was set to 2 (or higher), there would be an irritating
  flicker as the hard edges width would be 2 pixels wide when an edge was
  highlighed and 1 pixel wide when a face or vertex was selected.
  (Thanks to Gordo.) [bjorng]

--- 1.0-rc1 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- This is the first release candiate for the long-awaited Wings 1.0 release.
  Until 1.0 is released, we will only fix bugs. [bjorng]

- Wings now uses Gordos's new design for icons and about screen. [bjorng]

- Save handling in Tweak Mode has been fixed. [optigon]

- Text plugin when used with the native Wings browser would crash. Now fixed.
  [optigon]

- Selected vertices and edges would not show up on top of elements marked as
  the original selection. Now fixed. [optigon]

- Bug fix to Circularise to maintain the diameter of already circular loops.
  [optigon]

- Vertex|Weld could crash if the resulting geometry formed a waist. A check is
  now performed to prevent this action. [optigon]

--- 0.99.60 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- If you are building this release from source, you must use Erlang/OTP R13B
  (which was recently released).

  Note for users of Power PC based Macs: I no longer own a Power PC Mac,
  so although the Mac version of Wings is still distributed as a Universal
  application, it has not been tested on a Power PC Mac. [bjorng]

- Rewrite of Edge|Circularise to cleanup code, and add/improve features.
  - Improved automatic normal picking with internal checks so that users
    will be less likely to have to reverse normals or specify the angle type
    (obtuse or acute).
  - Closed loops now start off circularised to 100%, instead of having to drag
    from 0%. This percentage can be adjusted during the drag sequence by
    pressing and holding the Rmb while moving the mouse.
  - Closed loop selections are now resized according to either Diametric
    Factor or Absolute Diameter (switch between the two by pressing [3]).
  - The problem of using repeat arguments and having the diameter default to
    1.0, has been fixed.
  - The Lmb command now works on both open and closed loops without having to
    input a secondary plane selection.
  - The Rmb command allows the input of a common plane for flattening all the
    loops, open or closed.
  - The Mmb command replaces the old Rmb command, and allows you to specify
    the end result through secondary selections.
  [optigon]

- Improved seaching for Similar Normals and Materials for connected faces and
  added the ability to select similar vertex colours via Similar Materials.
  [optigon]

- Tweak Mode bugfixes. (Thanks to gordo and Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- Changed default Hard Edge colour to orange {1.0,0.5,0.0}. [optigon]

- Masked vertices will now display slightly larger than the Selected Vertex Size
  when in vertex mode even if they are set smaller in the preferences.
  (Thanks to Fonte Boa). [optigon]

--- 0.99.55 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- Separated the .ai and .ps|.eps import plugins, and changed them so that
  objects are centered when they open in Wings. [optigon]

- Removed all code that supported basic menus. Plug-ins that use the
  {basic,...}  and {advanced,...} constructs in menus must
  be updated. [bjorng]

- Merging objects with masked vertices would not transfer masked elements
  correctly. Now fixed. [optigon]

- Added Tools|Magnet Mask|Invert, which allows you to invert the masked/unmasked
  vertices. Only highlighted objects are inverted, unless there is no highlight,
  in which case all object's masks are inverted. [optigon]

- Added toggle to switch the Magnet Mask On/Off. [optigon]

- Fixed another crash in AutoUV caused by my change in 0.99.54.
  Basically, I reverted my change I made 0.99.54, so this should be
  the last crash caused by that clean-up. [bjorng]

--- 0.99.54a ----------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed mirror side Tweak mode selection bug reported by Fonte Boa. [optigon]

- New Feature: File|Import|PostScript(.ps) allows Wings to import .ps files from
  such applications as Inkscape. This feature reuses code from the .ai import
  plugin originally written by Howard Trickey. [optigon]

- Fixed a bug which I introduced when I cleaned up some code and corrected
  a mis-feature.

  (Details: wings_io:get_matchings_events/1 used to return message in the
  reversed order compared to in the order they were put into the queue;
  I changed that so messages are returned in the same order as they were
  queued. Code in at least one other place (wings_toolbar) depended on
  the exact order of the messages.) [bjorng]

--- 0.99.54 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- Extended Edge|Circularise Lmb to handle multiple open edge loops. [optigon]

- Added mmb select option to Tweak, for Maya camera mode users. [optigon]

- Improvements and bug fixes to dragging.
  - Now drag position won't jump when constraints are released.
  - The numeric tab entry now shows units achieved via constraints.
  - Constraint effects now are limited to only the active drag parameter.
  - Tools limiting drag distances to a range, would continue to tabulate past
    their allowed limits, which could result in the user dragging blindly with no
    effect until the drag distance fell between the limits again.
  - Zooming would cause the current drag distance to jump when using tools with
    mixed drag modes like Sweep, Contour, and Circularise.
  [optigon]

- Fixed menus so that they won't cover up the Info Line. [optigon]

- Rewrite of the Contour plugin to improve both performance and functionality.
  It now appears as Inset in the face menu. [optigon]

- Extrude Region would occasionally omit an edge when processing poles with
  five or more edges (for instance when extruding three or more faces on the top
  end of the sphere primitive). Now fixed. [optigon]

- Another rewrite of Sweep, mainly to improve processing speed.  Other changes
  include a better implementation of Sweep for individual faces, and a new
  option to Freeze/Thaw the base of the extrusion. [optigon]

- New Feature: View|Position Camera allows you to position the camera
  numerically. Includes a preview mode for flipping betweeen the old view
  and new view by pressing '1'. From the preview, pressing lmb re-opens the
  camera position dialog, and rmb accepts the current view and exits the
  preview. [optigon]

- New option, File|Save Unused Materials, can be checkmarked if you want to save
  all the materials from a scene, including the ones not applied to your model,
  to a .wings file. [optigon]

- BzFlag exporter added to Wings. [contributed by trepan and optic delusion with
  minor changes by optigon]

- German translation updates from Torsten Manz.

- New Feature: Tools|Magnet Mask|Lock/Unlock. Locks the positions of vertices
  against the effects of magnets in both Tweak and Magnet mode with the
  exception that masked vertices within a selection will not be locked.
  Display options are included in Edit|Preferences|General > Magnet Mask vertex
  colour and size including alpha.
  There are also the option View|Show|Show Magnet Mask which toggles the display
  and Select|By|Magnet Mask. [optigon]

- For Developers: There are new options for adding draw lists for plugins via
  #dlo{plugins=[]} added to the wings.hrl. You can follow the example plugin
  wpc_magnet_mask.erl and check the functions added to wings_plugin.erl to get
  an idea of what this is all about or ask questions/add suggestions on the
  Wings 3D Official Development Forum. [optigon]

--- 0.99.53 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- Kerkythea exporter added to Wings. [contributed by Chris Hegarty (Avariant)]

- Added a file browser to the Text plugin. [optigon]

- Tweak can now use single and double clicking to select geometry. There is an
  options panel beside the Tools|Tweak menu heading where you can set the
  click speed and also turn off this feature. There is also an option to reduce
  the number of button used to activate Tweak Slide. (Thanks to puzzledpaul,
  Fonte Boa, and marcin wuu for their input). [optigon]

- Added temporary highlight selection for Edge Loop, Edge Ring, Select All, and
  Select Similar commands. Now, you can extend a selection by pressing the
  associated hotkey over a highlighted element. An option to activate this
  feature can be found in the Edit|Preferences|Advanced dialog. [optigon]

- Bug fixes for the mode specific hotkey implementation. [optigon]

- Code imporvements and an extension of the Select|Similar Normals command.
  The command now has a new preference to save the Angle Tolerance, which in
  combination with the Connected Faces Only option, makes this tool great for
  selecting face regions bounded by sharp edges. [optigon]

- Some object mode selections would cause crashes when used in conjunction with
  the Duplicate command. (Reported by Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- Dragging Lights as an edge selection in Tweak mode would crash. Now fixed.
  [optigon]

- Mouse over highlighted items are now added temporarily to a drag operation
  in Tweak. [optigon]

- Following a Slide+Clean operation in Tweak, if any short edges were collapsed,
  then an empty selection will now be returned. Returning the original selection
  was offen times unsafe, because the selected element might have been removed,
  causing Wings to crash. [optigon]

- Toggling wireframe display for objects in the Geometry Graph using the right
  mouse button option would not yeild the correct results in some situations.
  Now fixed. (Reported by pauljs75). [optigon]

- Select by material called from the Outliner would select hidden faces. This
  has been corrected. (Thanks to odf). [optigon]

- Blocked some face selection tools from selecting hidden faces. [optigon]

--- 0.99.52 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- Moving an object in tweak mode would not disregard an existing virtual mirror.
  Now fixed. (Thanks to yst). [optigon]

- Contour would not produce predictable results when a selected region touched
  the seam of the virtual mirror. Now fixed. (Thanks to yst). [optigon]

- Circularise would crash when called with but a single edge selected. Now an
  error message is returned. (Thanks to yst). [optigon]

- Tools|Unitize would crash when called using a selection that contained a
  light. (Thanks to yst). [optigon]

- Edge|Cut 2/3/4 while in Tweak mode can now be called if the Magnet is turned
  off. Otherwise, the 2/3/4 keys change the Magnet type. [optigon]

--- 0.99.51 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- Some Menubar commands are now selection mode specific and as such their
  hotkeys are now context sensitive. This change affects the Select|Edge Loop
  items, some of the Select Similar commands, and Tools|Virtual Mirror|Create.
  [optigon]

- The default hotkeys for Select Prev/Next Edge Loop have been changed to F6
  and F7. If you had those F keys previously assigned to another command, then
  Select Prev/Next will be have no hotkey where conflicts exist. This change
  was made to accommodate recent changes to Tweak mode, and solves a conflict
  with the xyz contraint keys (F1/2/3). [optigon]

- Tweak's xyz constraints can now be toggled on/off by clicking the Alt key in
  conjuction with the axis (F1,F2,F3) you wish to lock. For example, clicking
  F1 and Alt will toggle the X axis constraint on/off. More than one axis can
  be locked at a time. Held keys for axes already toggled on, nullify the
  constraint, and held keys for axes toggled off are additive. [optigon]

- Tab Input for Move in the UVmapper would crash Wings. (Thanks to betelguese).
  [optigon]

- Tweak Move Normal did not handle some situations correctly. (Thanks to yst).
  [optigon]

--- 0.99.50 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- Tweak mode compatibility fixes for Maya and Motionbuilder cameras. [optigon]

- New option to launch Wings in Tweak Mode (Preferences|Advanced). [optigon]

- Auto Rotate now works in Tweak. [optigon]

- Advanced menus are now always turned on. There will be a information
  dialog when you start Wings if you have been using Wings with the
  advanced menus turned off. [bjorng]

- Set default Menu and Dialog Background alpha to 0.99 to (hopefully) avoid
  future reports of the top most Menu items not appearing. [optigon]

--- 0.99.06 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- Internal changes: Warnings were eliminated and all unnecessary imports
  were removed. (Thanks to Richard Carlsson.) [bjorng]

- The experimental Toxic exporter has been removed. [bjorng]

- Canceling commands while dragging (rmb), would only work while the mouse was
  relatively motionless. Now fixed. (Thanks to zukas.) [optigon]

- Major rewrite of the Tweak plugin to allow multiple selections and access to
  all the regular Wings commands from within Tweak. Be sure to check the info
  line as some of the hotkey combos have changed. (Thanks to Fonte Boa, marcin
  wuu, and all those who helped during testing.) [optigon]

- Shear's relative mode was broken in the last release. Now Fixed (Thanks to
  pauljs75.) [optigon]

- Some wording changes to the mouse response preferences. (Thanks to plec.)
  [optigon]

- Drag response factors in FOV. (Thanks to plec.) [optigon]

--- 0.99.05 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- New Feature: Select|Similar Material selects all faces of the same material to
  the original face. You can select only those faces which are connected to the
  original face and share at least one edge by check marking "Connected Faces
  Only" in the options panel. [optigon]

- In the AutoUV window, scaling non-continous faces with magnet would
  crash Wings. (Thanks to zukas.) [bjorng]

- Selecting every face on an object and calling Contour would crash wings. Now
  fixed. [optigon]

- Changed [+/-] drag modifiers to use RMB+Drag. Affects Vertex and Edge Extrude,
  Face|Bump, and Vertex|Deform|Shear. [optigon]

- Virtual Mirror and some other commands in the Tools menu would not accept a
  temporary highlight as a selection when they were called via hotkeys. Now
  fixed. (Thanks to SoulVector.) [optigon]

- View|Show items were broken. (Thanks to pauljs75.) [optigon]

- If a graphics card indicated that it had shader support, but actually using
  shaders didn't work for any reason, Wings would crash when attempting to
  use the View menu. Now Wings correctly handles this situation and removes
  the Shaders from the View menu if shaders doesn't work.
  (Thanks to FranOnTheEdge.) [bjorng]

- Smoothing groups in Wavefront import are now handled (i.e. hard edges
  will be created between faces in different smoothing groups). [bjorng]

--- 0.99.04a ----------------------------------------------------------------
- The Image Plane command will now create an internal image if it needs to
  pad a non-power-of-two image, fixing a long-standing bug that images in
  image planes would be stretched after saving and reloading. [bjorng]

- When importing a model with a face having duplicated vertices, Wings
  would not correctly clean up the face if the face had U/V coordinates
  or vertex colors, causing a crash. (Thanks to Krurukyk.) [bjorng]

- Wings would crash when importing "unconventional" OBJ files (a "g"
  command followed by an "o" command). [bjorng]

- Connect should now work in arbitrarily small faces. (The Connect command
  will still prevent the creation of long, extremely thin faces, but the
  test is now relative, not absolute, so it should work for a face of
  any size.) [bjorng]

--- 0.99.04 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- New Feature: Circularise now works on open edge loops, and by pressing '1'
  during the drag phase of the tool, you can choose to flatten or not flatten
  the result to a single plane. [optigon]

- New Feature: View|Highlight Aim aims the camera at the mouseover highlight
  even while other geometry is selected. Options in Edit|Preferences|Advanced
  allow you to specify Highlight Aim's targeting behaviour. Although the
  original View|Aim command remains, the Wings default hotkey 'A' now calls
  View|Highlight Aim instead. [optigon]

- Repeating Move|Region in selection modes other than Face caused Wings to
  crash. Also Flatten, Rotate, and Scale Region, and Rotate|Normal in Vertex
  and Body mode. Now fixed. [optigon]

- Selecting every face of an object during a vector op would crash wings.
  Now fixed. [optigon]

- New vector op added. Define a vector between the centers of two edge loops
  on either a single object or one loop on each of two objects. [optigon]

- Partial rewrite of Sweep plugin to improve the code including:
  - Vertices on separate objects sharing the same id number, would cause
    unexpected results. Vertices are now processed correctly.
  - Sweep|Free side to side motion was reversed. Now fixed. (Thanks to GetaVe)
  - Added Relative mode to Sweep commands.
  - Improvements to processing speed.
  - Placed commands in single menu to save vertical space.
  [optigon]

- New utility Tools|Memory Usage.  Measures how much memory your current scene
  is using. (Thanks to Giniu.) [optigon]

- New colour prefs for the Menu Bar and Info Line backgrounds. [optigon]

- Reorganized Edit|Preferences to save vertical space. [optigon]

- Reorganized View menu. Placed similar menu items in View|Show to save vertical
  space. [optigon]

- Deselecting with nothing selected would add an unnecessary undo state. Now
  fixed. (Thanks to Giniu.) [optigon]

- Lowered minimum undo level to 1 (Edit|Preferences|Misc). [optigon]

- Changed default camera mode to Wings 3D for fresh install. [optigon]

- Made most of the Defined Hotkeys translatable. This also affects commands
  displayed in Edit|Repeat and the Plugin Manager. [optigon]

- New Feature: Rotate to Target allows you to rotate a selection using a
  geometry specified angle.  Enable magnets by pressing [Alt] when initiating
  the tool. [optigon]

- Disabled translation macros for Save and Open in Windows because they could
  cause Wings to crash when displaying Latin 5 characters in native dialogs.
  Furthermore, it is highly recommended that you do not save wings files using
  accented or non-English characters. (Thanks to Devilgreen.)[optigon]

- New Feature: Move|Planar allows you to move any selection freely upon a single
  plane. Choose any standard axis or a vector defined plane. Enable magnets by
  pressing [Alt] when initiating the tool. [optigon]

- New! Turkish translation [contributed by Devilgreen]

- Further updates to the German translation [contributed by Torsten Manz]

- The shaders have been enabled again. Now there is a much better mechanism
  for choosing shaders: a proper submenu, which also shows the currently
  selected shader. As before, they can be turned off by choosing the default
  light. [Scorpius]

- Added camera prefs for Rotation Speed and made panning via the
  arrow keys optional. See Edit|Preferences|Camera. [optigon]

- Added new features to Body|Flip including user defined point, axis, and global
  axis options. Holding down Alt while initiating the command duplicates the
  object before flipping it. (Inspired by ggaliens' Flip Global plugin.)
  [optigon]

- Rmb option added to Face|Dissolve to clean up any isolated vertices created by
  the Dissolve command. This feature already existed for edges, so it made sense
  to add it for faces. [optigon]

- Added ability to hotkey menu commands that bring up an Options Box such as
  those in the Primitives and Select Menu. [optigon]

- New Feature: Face|Contour creates edges around or inside a selected face
  region and allows you to move them parallel to the original edges. Works best
  for square geometry. Interface includes switching between Average, Normalise,
  and Stay on Line which provide 3 possible solutions to keeping the edges
  parallel. Hold down the rmb while dragging to bump the selection up or down
  acccording to either the face normals, or the region's normal. This feature
  now replaces the original Inset command. [optigon]

- Added a new option to the existing tool Select|Similar Normals, which allows
  you to select just those faces with similar normals that are connected to the
  original face. This allows you to select an island of faces with similar
  normals to the first, as opposed to all of them. [optigon]

- Added Flatten command to the Edge menu. [optigon]

--- 0.99.03 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- Move|Region could crash if the selection contained faces that only
  shared a single vertex (and not any edge). Now a proper error message
  is given. Same correction for the Scale, Rotate, and Flatten commands
  operating on regions. (Thanks to optigon.) [bjorng]

- Face mode area readout in the status bar would cause Wings to slow down if
  the the face contained too many vertices. Wings now only calculates the area
  for a face with less than 50 vertices. (Thanks to jdcooke1.) [optigon]

- View|Frame would symmetrically frame elements when using the virtual mirror.
  Now there is an option, View|Frame Disregards Mirror, to alter this behaviour.
  (Thanks to extrudeface and Entity325.) [optigon]

- New Feature: Face|Sweep/Sweep Region/Sweep Extract. Sweep is an interactive
  tool designed to make angled extrusions, while also allowing you to scale
  and rotate the extruded regions simultaneously. [optigon]

- The Plug-In manager could crash or fail to provide information for
  certain (correctly written) plug-ins. (Thanks to optigon.) [bjorng]

- New! German translation [contributed by Torsten Manz]

- New Feature: Edge|Circularise. A plugin to flatten, equalise, and inflate an
  edge loop to its maximum or user specified diameter. Basic and Advanced menu
  options availble. [optigon]

- Now using Erlang/OTP R12B-3. [bjorng]

--- 0.99.02 -----------------------------------------------------------------
- Now using Erlang/OTP R12B-1. The build instructions have been updated with
  more details. The SDL library in the Linux distribution no longer references
  libaa (thanks to vtechk). [bjorng]

- Verbose and Mouseover info text options added to Edit|Preferences|General.
  [optigon]

- Added interface options to Edit|Preferences|General. Options to
  edit the width of Hard Edges and Normals, and set the default colour
  of the Default and Hole Material. Also, the Mini Axis can now be
  switched on or off and the colour of its axes are now linked to the
  main axes. [optigon]

- Wings could crash when triangulating (for display purposes)
  extremely degenerated polygons. For instance, Cylindrical Shift
  on a cylinder could cause the problem. (Thanks to pauljs75.)
  [bjorng]

- In secondary selection mode, invoking some selection commands (such
  as Select|Similar Normals) would cause a crash.  Also, invoking
  Select|Similar Normals through a hotkey in the wrong selection mode
  (i.e. not face mode) would cause a crash. (Thanks to optigon.)
  [bjorng]

- Optional Feature: Changing modes while dragging would make the model
  jump. Mode changes can now be set to reset the model back to its initial
  position. [optigon]

- Fixed the repeat drag arguments (Shift D and D) for Vertex Intersect,
  Bend, and Shift. [optigon]

- Basic mode Turn menu now cascades. [optigon]

- Extended vector ops to accept vectors defined across multiple objects.
  Also added Cross Product as a way to define a vector using two edges.
  [optigon]

- New Feature: Vertex|Deform|Inflate Cylindrical. Works in both basic
  and advanced menus. In basis menus, select a central axis (XYZ) and
  inflate. In advanced menus, pick a central axis and optionally, pick
  a center point and radius. Vertices will move towards the radius along
  a vector extending from the center point. All vertices are aligned with
  the radius when the distance reads 100%. [optigon]

- New Feature: Vertex|Connect(RMB)|Connecting Edge (advanced menus only).
  Creates a new edge by connecting the selected vertices and returns the
  new edge already selected. [optigon]

- New Feature: Edit|Preferences|Constraints > Drag Preferences.
  Allows you to customize dragging speeds for Rotational, Absolute,
  and Relative drags. [optigon]

- New Feature: This preliminary release of the new Set Constraints plugin
  gives you the ability to take measurement directly from your model and
  save them as default constraints which can be used while dragging. You
  can take measurements in various ways including the use of secondary
  selections and vector ops. Bind the constraint to the modifier key(s)
  of your choice (Alt,Shift,Ctrl) by holding them down while accepting a
  method of measurement or set a default key combo in the prefs. If the
  measurement includes a secondary selection, you may hold down the modifier
  keys when finalizing your selection. [optigon]

  Edge Mode:
    Total Length - total length of the selected edges
    Average Length - average length of the selected edges
    Angle - angle between two edges
    Subtract Angle - difference of two angles
    Edge To Axis - angle between a single edge and a chosen axis
    Percentage - difference two selections as a percentage
    Difference - difference in length of two selections,
    Centers - distance between the centers of two selections
  Face Mode:
    Percentage - difference in area between two face selections as a percentage
    Centers, Angle, Subtract Angle, Face To Axis
  Vertex Mode:
    Centers

- New Feature: Switch constraint sets on the fly while dragging. Every drag
  mode now has two related sets of constraints. You can switch to the related
  constraint set by press Shift+Tab while dragging in any tool. The related
  sets are as follows.
  Scale Factor/Reciprocal: Reciprocal is equal to 1/Scale Factor
  Angle/Supplementary: Supplementary is equal to 180 - Angle
  Distance/Alternate Distance: Two sets for distance constraints
  [optigon]

- New Feature: Vertex|Deform|Shear. This plugin lets you shear vertex selections
  and more! Drag in all three modes (Absolute, Angle, Relative). Add curve to
  the shear. Use vector ops or standard axes(XYZ). Many thanks to puzzledpaul
  for testing and offering useful suggestions. [optigon]

- Increased limits of the main Wings primitives to infinity. [optigon]

- The hotkeys for Toggle Proxy Mode and Quick Smoothed Preview (Shift+Tab)
  are now properly ignored in interactive commands and when the camera is active.
  (Thanks to optigon.) [bjorng]

- When defining hotkeys for menus such as Edit|Preferences or pop-up menus
  when advanced menus were not turned on, there could be a useless question
  about mouse buttons. This question has been eliminated. [bjorng]

- The Wavefront importer will now import objects that have defects such
  as invalid texture coordinate references. Instead of crashing, texture
  coordinates will be removed from the face in question. Also, import of
  Wavefront files with relative vertex references will be faster (much
  faster for big files). (Thanks to terje7601.) [bjorng]

- Added new camera modes: Google SketchUp and Wings 3D suggested by oort.
  Wings 3D mode is the same as Mirai mode, except that the mmb pans instead
  of dollying. Added optional scroll wheel activated pan and rotate (available
  in all camera modes). Also extended arrow key panning to work in all modes
  and improved its useability. [optigon]

--- 0.99.01  ----------------------------------------------------------------

- New feature: Edit|Plug-In Manager. It allows you to selectively
  enable and disable plug-ins; for instance, you can turn off all
  export and import plug-ins for formats that you never use. (Note to
  translators: Since there may be changes to this feature, depending
  on the feedback, I have deliberately not made the strings
  translatable yet.) [bjorng]

- Hotkeys can now also be assigned to commands that are invoked using
  MMB or RMB. [bjorng]

- On Windows, Wings will now remember if it was maximized when it was
  quitted, and automatically start maximized next time. [bjorng]

- View|Saved Views|Save will now count as change, so that the file can be
  saved immediately without workarounds such as selecting something first.
  (Thanks to oort.) [bjorng]

- Tweak mode: There would be a crash if you attempted to relax a face
  next to a hidden face.  Also updated the look of the information in
  line to look more as the rest of Wings. Also made sure that
  modifiers that will not work in the Motionbuilder camera mode are
  not shown on the information line. [bjorng]

- Turn command: In the basic menus, there are now three Turn commands:
  "Turn clockwise", "Turn counter-clockwise", and "Turn Optimized".
  In advanced menus, those three commands can be chosen using LMB,
  MMB, and RMB. The preference dialog in Edit|Plug-in Preferences has
  been eliminated. There is no longer any automatic hotkeys assigned.
  There will now be an error dialog if you have selected more than one
  edge in the same face (instead of a mess). [bjorng]

- Help|OpenGL Info now also reports the SDL version. [bjorng]

- The experimental support for cycling shaders have been turned off
  until it can be done properly. [bjorng]

- The Portuguese and French translations have been updated.

--- 0.99.00b ----------------------------------------------------------------

- Creating a normal map for a material was so slow so that it seemed
  that Wings was frozen. Now back to normal speed. :-) [bjorng]

- Attempting to create or edit a material when the Yafray plug-in was active
  would cause a crash. Corrected. [bjorng]

- Eliminated the problem that caused some language files to be corrupted
  on Windows. Also added verification to the the build process so that
  this problem will be detected if it should occur again. [bjorng]

- In the Misc tab in Edit | Preferences, "Camera moves and interactive commands
  are jumpy" is now default on all versions of Mac OS X. A buggy version number
  check turned it off on Leopard. (Thanks to jtico.) [bjorng]

--- 0.99.00a ----------------------------------------------------------------

- Clicking the toolbar to deselect would crash or freeze Wings.
  (Thanks to yst.) [bjorng]

- The installer for Windows will now install the run-time library for
  Microsoft C if it is not already installed. [bjorng]

--- 0.99.00 -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Cosmetic improvements: the menu selector has a subtle gradient, and the title
  bars have the common aqua/vista effect. Also added optional History Buttons
  (aka Undo/Redo) and Open/Save icons on menubar. [Scorpius]

- Added more shaders (brick, toon, environment-mapping, gooch-tone), which can
  now be toggled (or cycled) through a choice in the view menu. Requires an
  OpenGL 2.0 video card. [Scorpius]

- Revised most primitives, they are now more accurate and have more options.
  [contributed by Richard Jones (Optigon)]

- Ability to set drag constraints for the currently pressed modifier key(s).
  When one edge is selected the distance constraint is set; when two are
  selected the rotation constraint is set. [Scorpius & Optigon]

- Added ISO-8859-9 font support. [contributed by Ismail Keskin (Devilgreen)]

- Added search in relative paths when loading textured models. [dgud]

- Ability to set drag constraints. [contributed by Richard Jones (Optigon)]

- Small add to right mouse button absolute snap, now you can lock movement
  in x, y or z. [Giniu]

- Changes to absolute scale, ability to link sizes (uniform scale), ability to
  pick scale centre from scene using RMB absolute scale, ability to pick target
  size from scene using MMB absolute scale and option to fit selection into
  picked target by automatically adjusting scale centre. [Giniu]

- PovRay exporter and renderer added.
  [contributed by Chris Hegarty (Avariant)]

- Added a live miniature-axis icon to the lower-left corner of the screen.
  [Scorpius]

- Added a user defined clipping-plane. Use 'Set Default Axis' to interactively
  change the orientation of the plane.

- Edges can now be displayed with Anti-Aliasing, see preferences. [Scorpius]

- Added Russian translation by Paul Geraskin. [bjorng]

- Major update to Portuguese translation [contributed by: Luiz Fonte Boa]

--- 0.98.36 -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Absolute snap now can pick reference point, old snap that used center of
  selection as reference point was moved to MMB option. [Giniu]

- Added new preference: constrain axes to grid. [Scorpius]

- Added "Blue Cube" interface icons. The original icons are in the "Classic"
  bundle. Switching between icon sets is easily accomplished through the
  User Interface preference tab. [Scorpius]

- Revived the Plane Plugin, which was removed from a previous release
  because it created invalid objects. This has been fixed by adding a
  thickness parameter; thereby creating a properly closed mesh. [Scorpius]

- Added two new primitives (look under the More menu):
  Tube: generates a hollow tube or pipe with an actual wall-thickness.
  Gear: generates a very simple gear. Allows the user to specify the number
  of teeth and the tooth height. [Scorpius]

- Added two more primitives:
  Ncube: Generates a cube with an arbitrary level of subdivisions (simply
  specify the number of cuts per edge) plus a spherize option.
  Ngon: Generates a polygon with an arbitrary number of vertices. This may
  look like a single-sided polygon but, in fact, has two faces. [Scorpius]

- New GeoDome primitive. Generates a geodesic dome with an arbitrary level
  of subdivisions. Has three base objects, spherize and half-dome options.
  [Scorpius]

- New *.stl import/export plugin. Stereolithography files can be sent to
  a service bureau to create an actual plastic prototype of your model.
  [Scorpius]

- New command in tools menu: "Scene Info: Area & Volume." Calculates the
  area and volume for each object in the scene and displays the info in
  a pop-up window. [Scorpius]

- Bug fix: Language support now works for all operating systems, regardless
  if the file path has an underscore. [Scorpius]

- Added X export plugin.
  [contributed by Ed Kolis (Ekolis)]

- New command in tools menu: "Put on Ground." It simply moves the selected
  objects vertically until they rest on the ground plane. [Scorpius]

- Added "Purple Tube" interface icons. Check the User Interface preference
  tab to switch between icon sets. [Scorpius]

- New commands in 'Select->By' menu: "Fewest Edges Path" selects a path
  (between any two selected vertices) with the fewest number of edges.
  "Shortest Path" selects a path with the shortest distance. If more than one
  possible solution exists, the first one found will be selected. [Scorpius]

- New secondary mode for dissolve, called clean dissolve.
  [contributed by Richard Jones (Optigon)]

- Added ability to set alternate zoom speed, check camera preferences.
  [contributed by Richard Jones (Optigon)]

- Tweak tool extended with new features like tangent, relax, slide and more.
  [contributed by Andrew Shpagin (AndrewShpagin)]

- French translation updated, with many more plug-ins translated.
  [contributed by Nicolas Bouillard (syndarion)]

- The Mac version of Wings is now a Universal Binary that runs on both
  PowerPC and Intel Macs. [bjorng]

- The Windows version now includes the correct (latest) version of the
  SDL dll, correcting numerous problems. [bjorng]

--- 0.98.35 -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Move absolute now works for lights. [Giniu]

- Added very basic version of absolute scale, it would be extended
  after feedback. [Giniu]

- Both absolute scale and move is now placed in one menu group,
  in absolute commands. [Giniu]

- New absolute tool was added - snap - it is similar to move but
  works with secondary selection. There two snap modes, quick LMB and
  full RMB. Simple weld was eaten by quick version of snap. [Giniu]

- Fixed bug in View -> Align to Selection. [Giniu]

- Turn Edge plugin now have option dialog to choose between clasic
  turn method, clockwise rotate and counterclockwise rotate. [Giniu]

- An improved modelling lighting for people with newer gfx cards,
  select 'one light' [Dgud]

- Improved rotate command again when using constraints [Dgud]

- Change the automatic chart rotation again in autouv [Dgud]

- Hopefully fixed the unfold issue from inside the autouv window [Dgud]

- New selection method: by sharp edges.
  [contributed by Anthony D'Agostino (Scorpius)]

- Polish translation fixes.
  [contributed by Maciej Milewski]

- Minor corrections for Mac and Windows to work with R11B and newest
  SDL and esdl. For Mac, Mac OS 10.4 or higher ("Tiger") is now required.
  (Unless you build from source yourself.) Sorry for that. [bjorng]

--- 0.98.34 -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Minor autouv fixes.

- Fixed stored selection bug reported by LoTekK.

- Added a loop cut mode to (tools) connect tool.

- Fixed very small bug in vertex weld (troubles with undo).

- Added second vertex weld mode for those who prefers just moving vertices
  to target position and then clean mesh (it's under RMB click on "Weld").

- Totally rewrote absolute move so now is works for any selection mode,
  and is able to align, move whole objects and create multiple duplicates of object.
  [Giniu]

- Should now hopefully work on Mac OS 10.3.9 ("Panther").
  Erlang/OTP updated to R10B-10, which has a fix for a rare
  start-up problem. [Bjorn]

--- 0.98.33 -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Dan fixed (hopefully finally) the Rotate commands speed so they work as before.

- Dan fixed rotate in vertex mode so it centers around all selected vertices.

- Giniu made all active (compilable) plug-ins translatable and translated them to Polish
  (the toxic and yafray plugins still needs to be translated, but are translatable).

- Giniu added 4 selection methods: select by vertices with 6 or more edges,
  select by non quadrangle faces (all faces, faces with odd or even number of edges).

- Giniu added two new tools - "move->absolute" for positioning in absolute
  coordinates and "weld" for welding single vertex to other one.

- DesiredUserName/MicrobeSoft implemented pick-up and drop images in outliner.

- Syndarion updated the French translation.

- AUTOUV changes (Dan):
  - In face mode added a combined project from normal and unfolding command.
  - In segmenting mode, when uv-mapping failes the good charts gets uv-mapped and
    the failed charts stays in the segmenting window.
  - MMB on uv-mapping, finds and marks the old chart cuts.
  - Repeat implemented.
  - Other minor stuff, uv-grid and changed material/image handling.
  - Re-written the texture image creator, move images with your uv's or
    use it to draw vertex color or materials it can also use opengl shaders.

- Programmers:
  Update to the latest erlang release. (png requires it)
  Both the #we and #st have a new field pst (plugin state)
    That requires a re-compilation of most (all?) of the external plugins.
    Plugins that use the pst field should export two functions:
       PLUGIN:merge_we([We1,We2..]) and PLUGIN:merge_st(NewData,OldSt) both should
       return the new data of the plugin.

--- 0.98.32b -----------------------------------------------------------------

- Giniu made AutoUV and almost all other plug-ins translatable and
  translated them to Polish.

- Import, especially 3DS import, improved.

- Dan G fixed crash in the Connect tool. (Problem reported by Fonte Boa.)

- The Image creation command now correctly create images
  with size which are not multiples of 8 or 16.

- Dan G made sure wings files containing bad images created by previous
  versions of Wings can now be loaded, but with the faulty images
  missing. (Problem reported by Hanzaa.)

- Dan G fixed file open problem reported by Bob19971.

- The length and color of normals shown by View|Show Normals can now
  be changed in the preferences. (By Giniu.)

- Dmitry Efremov has updated the hlines plug-in.

- Changed toxic to render png instead of tga. (By Dan G.)

- Dan G fixed the Rotate commands speed so they work as before.

- Raimo added an option for loading rendered image into
  internal viewer independent from external viewer option.

AutoUV (by Dan G):

- New commands in edge mode: slide, distribute evenly.

- New commands in object mode:Normalize Chart sizes.

- The Scale and Rotate commands now have magnets.


For developers:

- New function e3d_mesh:make_polygons/1. e3d_mesh:make_quads/1 changed back
  to only make quads.
