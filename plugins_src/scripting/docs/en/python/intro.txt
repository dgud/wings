Introduction

<h3>.wscr File</h3>

For your script to be able to appear in the script chooser dialog, you will need to make a wscr file with the same base name as your main python script file. For example, if your script file is example.py, your wscr file should be named example.wscr. The name that appears in the script chooser is the name specified in the wscr file.

<h3>Initial Bootstrap Script</h3>

A bootstrap script that comes with the script plugin is first launched which then defines some basic functions, sometimes adds include paths, and gets from stdin the actual script being invoked as well as parameters that goes with it.

<h3>Parameters that are passed in</h3>

When a script is invoked, parameters from the dialog box are passed in, other parameters are also passed in depending on the type of script.

<h3>Returning values from the script</h3>

Scripts write to stdout an OutputList before exiting.

<h3>Calling functions in Wings3D from a script</h3>

Scripts can communicate with the plugin by setting temporary variables and using queries to call functions and get the return value. Temporary variables makes it easier to input elaborate data structures as arguments by referencing them in the query.


Set value to variable:

<code><pre>
    w3d_int.wings_set_var("var1", [1, 2, 3, 4])
</pre></code>

The return value should be <code><pre>["ok"]</pre></code>


Get value of variable:

<code><pre>
    w3d_int.wings_get_var("var1")
</pre></code>

The reply should be <code><pre>[[1, 2, 3, 4]]</pre></code>


Query:

<code><pre>
    w3d_int.wings_query("lists:reverse(<$'var1')")
</pre></code>

The reply should be <code><pre>[[4, 3, 2, 1]]</pre></code>


<h3>Calling We Functions</h3>

Most We functions are already wrapped into a defined function, and are covered in the we function reference.

Other functions can be called with
 wings_we__get(module,fun,*args)
 wings_we__change(module,fun,*args)



<h3>NewShape (w3d_newshape) Functions</h3>

The w3d_newshape module contains NewShape helper classes and can be imported with:

<code><pre>import w3d_newshape</pre></code>

<h3>E3D (w3d_e3d) Functions</h3>

The w3d_e3d module contains E3D helper classes and can be imported with:

<code><pre>import w3d_e3d</pre></code>

<h3>We (w3d_we) Functions</h3>

The w3d_we module contains Winged Edge functions for command scripts:

<code><pre>import w3d_we</pre></code>



<h3>Long Running Processes</h3>

If your script runs for a long time, you want to use the LongRunningProcess class. The LongRunningProcess class continues your script processing in another thread, while sending back keep-alive messages to Wings3D so the program knows that the script has not timed out.

<code><pre>
class Examp:
    def run(self):
        sum = 0
        for i in range(0, 100000000):
            sum = sum + i

print("Begin")
lrp = LongRunningProcess()
lrp.run(Examp())
print("Done")
</pre></code>
