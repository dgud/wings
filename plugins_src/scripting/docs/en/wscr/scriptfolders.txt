Script Folders

Script folder files are config files in the user data area where other software or the user can add new paths to find scripts.

Each script folder config file is written in erlang term syntax, similar to the syntax used for Wings3D language files.

<code><pre>
%% Syntax of config file, comment lines start with %

{&lt;Name&gt;,[
    {type,&lt;Type&gt;},
    {path,&lt;Paths&gt;}
]}.
</pre></code>

&lt;Name&gt; is a double quoted string of a unique name, for example "com.example.author.script-folders.name" or "author-name.script-folders.name".

&lt;Type&gt; is a list enclosed in [...] of: vertex, edge, face, body, shape

&lt;Paths&gt; is a list of double quoted string paths enclosed in [...]. So a list of one path is ["folder/"]. Paths can be absolute paths, or relative to your operating system user folder.

The config file is placed in the "script_folders" folder inside the wings user data folder, in the same directory as the plugins and patches folders.

<code><pre>
%% Example script folder .conf file:

{"com.example.wings-scripts-1",[
    {type,[shape]},
    {path,["a1/","a2/"]}
]}.

{"com.example.scripts.2",[
    {type,[face,body]},
    {path,["a/"]}
]}.
</pre></code>
