adv_param Directive
<code><pre>
<b>adv_params</b> <b>begin</b>
  {vframe, [
     {hframe,[
       {label,?__(3,"Path:")},
       {text,"testing2",[{key,path}]}]},
     panel,
     separator,
     {?__(2,"Enable"), 'true', [{key,enable}]}
  ]}
<b>end.</b>
</pre></code>

Adds parameters in the form of erlang term syntax, which allows
scripts to have more control over the user interface layout. The
erlang term syntax begins on the line after <b>begin</b> until
the line <b>end.</b>. NOTE that there must be a dot (.) immediately
after end on the same line, and end. must be on its own line.

The erlang term itself should <b>not</b> have a dot after the
term itself.

Locale strings ?__(1, "Text") and query values %[...] are available
to include inside the erlang term.

An <b>adv_param</b> directive should be inside a
<b>params { ... }</b> section.
