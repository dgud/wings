command_inputs Directive
<code><pre>
<b>command_inputs</b> "points,faces"
</pre></code>

For command scripts, sets a comma separated list of input information that
 will be sent to the script as part of the 
<tt>extra_params</tt> variable in Python, or the 
<tt>*extra-params*</tt> vaiable in Scheme.
 For example, if faces is specified, an item entry with the key faces will
 be available in extra params. This directive is not needed if the script
uses the we commands directly.

This directive is only used with command scripts, and only optionally as an
alternative to using the we commands directly.

Items can be:
  points,
  faces,
  face_colors,
  face_uvs,
  e3d_mesh
