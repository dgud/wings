command_changes Directive
<code><pre>
<b>command_changes</b> "points"
</pre></code>

For command scripts, sets a comma separated list of possible information
that will be changed by the script when making modifications to data from
command_inputs. This directive is not needed if the script uses we commands
to modify the shape directly.

This directive is only used with command scripts, and only optionally as an
alternative to using the we commands directly.

The e3d_mesh option provides an e3d mesh of the shape, which can be modified
by the script and then is recreated as a we object when returned back to wings.
Since the we object is changed to a e3d mesh and then back, it is possible that
all the numbering of vertices, edges and faces will be completely changed and any
special data that uses those numberings won't match anymore.

Items can be:
  points,
  face_colors,
  face_uvs,
  e3d_mesh
