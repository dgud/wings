include Directives
<code><pre>
<b>include</b> "(%)_dialog.inclr"
</pre></code>

WSCR files can include other files, it is recommended to move all the parameter
 related configuration to another file and add an include directive towards
 it so as to keep the main wscr file small.
 This is important as each time the user opens a script chooser dialog,
 every directory is traversed for every wscr file, and each wscr file found
 is read for it's information to display in the script chooser browser.
 
The script chooser traversal process reads every wscr file, but it does
 not read the include directives.
 When a script is invoked, the include directives are used to read the rest
 of the configuration.
 A parenthesis wrapped percent symbol "(%)"

 auto expands to the name of the .wscr file before the extension.
