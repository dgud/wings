After updating the xbm bitmap, some programs include the entire absolute path
inside of the xbm file, which breaks the xbm file. The beginning of the xbm 
file should look like this:

#define wpc_shape_from_scripts_btn_refresh_width 32
#define wpc_shape_from_scripts_btn_refresh_height 32
static unsigned char wpc_shape_from_scripts_btn_refresh_bits[] = {

Use xbm_to_hrl.escript to update the hrl from the xbm.
