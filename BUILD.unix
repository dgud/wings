BUILDING WINGS 3D ON UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS (including MacOS X)
==========================================================

This guide describes how you can build Wings on unix-like
systems, such as GNU Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and MacOS X.

After the general build instructions, there are separate
instructions for building a complete, standalone installation
package for MacOS X and for other Unix systems.

Required software
=================

The following software is needed to get Wings running
at all. Additional software is required if you want to
run all plug-ins and to build an installation package.

- The Wings source files. http://www.wings3d.com

- Erlang/OTP 22.2 or later. http://www.erlang.org
-- Preferably compiled against wxWidgets-3.1.3 or later.

- git or CL library at http://github.com/tonyrog/cl

- rebar3 (needed for building CL).

- A GNU compatible "make" program. Included with most unix-like
  systems; otherwise get it from http://www.gnu.org.

- bunzip2 for unpacking the Wings source tar file.
  Included with most unix-like systems; otherwise get it
  from http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2.

- OpenGL header files and libraries.

- OpenCL header files (optional)

Summary of build process
========================

The following is a quick summary of the build process.

* Download and install Erlang/OTP.
* Install OpenGL (and OpenCL) header files (if needed).
* Optionally install rebar.
* Download and unpack the Wings source file.
* Run "make".

Installing Erlang/OTP
=====================

Fetch a prebuilt package of Erlang or build it.

Build Erlang/OTP according to the instructions in the README file.

I recommend running "configure" with the following options:

	./configure --enable-threads --disable-hipe

Threads must be enabled to make sure that Erlang emulator is linked with
reentrant libraries. (--enable-threads is default on *most* platforms nowadays,
but better safe than sorry.)

HiPE is not used by Wings; but the reason I recommend disabling it is
that disabling HiPE also disables the use of floating point exceptions.
Floating point exceptions have caused Wings to crash occasionally.

When you have built Erlang/OTP, modify the PATH environment variable
so that the "erl" and "erlc" programs can be started from a shell prompt.

Installing rebar (optional, needed by CL)
=========================================

Download and build rebar like this:

   git clone https://github.com/erlang/rebar3
   cd rebar
   make

Read and follow the instructions that are printed.

Installing CL  (optional)
=========================

CL is fetched (via git) and built automagically if it is not available in
$ERL_LIBS (example export ERL_LIBS=/Users/bjorng/src)

A built CL is not required to use wings, but recommended,
some functionality will not be available without CL,
but the build will not fail if building cl fails.

Read cl/README for information of requirements, mainly
OpenCL headers in the right place.

You can build it separately outside of wings by:

Download and build like this:

   cd $ERL_LIBS
   git clone https://github.com/tonyrog/cl.git
   cd cl
   rebar3 compile


Fetching/Unpacking the Wings source code
===============================

$ git clone https://github.com/dgud/wings.git
$ cd wings

Or unpack it with

$ tar jxf wings-1.0.tar.bz2
$ cd wings-1.0

Building Wings
==============

Build Wings from the directory where the sources where unpacked.

Example:

$ pwd
/home/bjorng/wings-1.0
$ make
.

<A lot of output follows>
.
$

To run the Wings you have just build, you'll need to write a command line
similar to this:

	erl -pa <MY_WINGS_PATH>/ebin -run wings_start start_halt

where you should substitute <MY_WINGS_PATH> with the path to the Wings
source directory.

Example:

$ erl -pa /home/bjorng/wings-1.0/ebin -run wings_start start_halt
$

Instead of writing the command line every time you want to start Wings,
you can package it in a script like this:

#!/bin/sh
exec erl -pa /home/bjorng/wings-1.0/ebin -run wings_start start_halt ${1+"$@"}

Notes:

[1] "exec" kills the shell process running the script, saving a
    tiny amount of system memory.

[2] The "${1+"$@"}" thing passes along any arguments (or none) to Wings,
    allowing Wings to open up a wings file when it starts.


Building an installation package for MacOS X
============================================

To build everything and pack it into a DMG file, you'll need:

- Xcode 4.6.3 or later on Mountain Lion.

Make sure that your current directory is the directory in which the
sources were unpacked.

Example:

$ pwd
/Users/bjorng/wings_releases/wings-1.0
$

To build all (including the installer), run the following command:

$ make macosx
.
<A lot of output follows>
.
$

When everything is done, there should be a file named like

	wings-1.0-macosx.dmg

in the current directory.


Code-signing the Wings3D application on Mac OS X
================================================

If you are a member of Apple's Mac developer program and have
obtained a Developer ID certificate, you can sign the code for
Wings3D so that Gatekeeper will accept it. Do like this:

$ export WINGS_CODE_SIGN=yes
$ make macosx

You will be prompted for your login keychain password if the login
keychain is locked.


Building an installation package for Linux (and other Unix systems)
===================================================================

To build everything and put it into an installation package,
you'll need the following additional software:

- makeself.sh for building the installation package
  (a self-extractable bzip2 archive). http://megastep.org/makeself

Make sure that your current directory is the directory in which the
sources were unpacked.

Example:

$ pwd
/Users/bjorng/wings_releases/wings-1.0
$

To build all (including the installation package),
run the following command:

$ make unix
.
<A lot of output follows>
.
$

When everything is done, there should be a file named like

	wings-1.0-linux.bzip2.run

in the current directory.
